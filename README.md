# CS771 Course Project - Machine Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project for the CS771 course at IIT Kanpur, under the guidance of Professor Piyush Rai (Aug 2024 - Dec 2024). The project focuses on classifying emoticons using various machine learning models.

## Project Overview

### Key Models Implemented:
- Logistic Regression
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
- Random Forest

### Achievements:
- Achieved high accuracy scores across various models and datasets:
  - Logistic Regression: 98.4%
  - LSTM: 97.14%
  - KNN: 95%
  - Random Forest: 94.8%

### Image Classification:
- Implemented a multiclass classification model using the Progressive Model Adaptation approach.
- Used pre-trained ResNet50 V2 for feature extraction and applied a Learn-with-Prototype (LwP) classifier across ten diverse datasets.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Employed One-Hot Encoding and normalization techniques for data preprocessing.
- Used ReLU and Adam optimizer for Neural Network classifiers.
